pngtocss takes in a png file with a gradient in it and spits out the necessary CSS to
draw that gradient.  It only works with square pngs with two colour gradients (ie, one
start and one end) and only linear gradients.  It can handle horizontal, vertical and
diagonal gradients.

It does not support:
- radial gradients
- angular gradients (except for perfect diagonal)
- more than 2 colours
- alpha transparency
