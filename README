pngtocss takes in a png file with a gradient in it and spits out the necessary CSS to
draw that gradient.  It only works with square pngs with two colour gradients (ie, one
start and one end) and only linear gradients.  It can handle horizontal, vertical and
diagonal gradients.

It does not support:
- radial gradients
- angular gradients (except for perfect diagonal)
- more than 2 colours
- alpha transparency

See the examples/ directory for all the pngs that I've tested this with.  Feel free
to submit your own (keep them small).

See the src/ directory for the source code.

It's written in C, and uses libpng and zlib.  You'll need both of those to compile it.
Also, I wrote it on MacOSX, so I installed the libraries using ports.  You may need to
play with the Makefile if you're using a different OS.  Sorry, I don't have the time 
to test, but if you submit a pull request, I'll merge it.
